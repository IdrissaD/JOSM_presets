# Comprehensive preset for MTB trails

I wasn't quite satisfied by all the presets available for tagging trails from a mountainbiker point of view. I wanted one having all the useful tags and a detailed description of their values, because I was tired of having `mtb:scale`, `mtb:scale:uphill`, `smoothness` or `sac_scale` wiki pages open next to JOSM. This preset is only intended to tag singletracks (`highway = path`), as other presets are already perfect for doubletracks.
Tags are ordered by importance, see the OSM wiki page for [mountain biking](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Mountain_biking).
