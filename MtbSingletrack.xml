            <list_entry value="1" display_value="S1 - Smaller obstacles like roots and small stones" short_description=" Erosion damage may increase difficulty. Soil may be loose in places. Tight turns, but no hairpin turns. Riding requires care and attention, but no special skill. Obstacles can be ridden over" />
            <list_entry value="2" display_value="S2 - Obstacles such as large rocks and stones" short_description="Soil is often loose. Steps are expected. Wider hairpin turns, steepness of up to 70%. Requires some advanced riding skills" />
            <list_entry value="3" display_value="S3 - Many sections with large obstacles such as boulders and large roots" short_description="Many hairpin and off-balance turns. Slippery surface and talus sections may be found. The surface may be very slippery. Constant concentration and very good skills needed" />
            <list_entry value="4" display_value="S4 - Very steep and difficult, with sections having large boulders and roots" short_description="Frequent loose debris. Very steep sections with very tight hairpin turns and high steps that will cause the chainring to hit the ground. Some trials techniques will be necessary" />

If at all only short passages are available for accelerating and braking. Fallen trees may make very steep passages even more difficult. Very few Mountainbikers can actually ride at this level" />
