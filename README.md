# Comprehensive presets for MTB trails

## MtbSingletrack Presets

I wasn't fully satisfied by all the presets available for tagging mtb trails, especially singletracks. I wanted to have all the useful tags and a detailed description of their values, because I was fed up with the need to have mtb:scale, mtb:scale:uphill, smoothness or sac_scale wiki pages open next to JOSM.

Available in JOSM and at this address: https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Presets/MtbSingletrack

## Presets I took inspiration from

* [Presets/MountainbikeTrails](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Presets/MountainbikeTrails)
* [Presets/Mountainbike](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Presets/Mountainbike)
* Path item of JOSM Default Presets
