# Comprehensive presets for MTB trails

## MtbSingletrack Presets

I wasn't fully satisfied by all the presets available for tagging trails from a mountainbiker point of view. I wanted one having all the useful tags and a detailed description of their values, because I was tired of having `mtb:scale`, `mtb:scale:uphill`, `smoothness` or `sac_scale` wiki pages open next to JOSM. This preset is only intended to tag singletracks (''highway = path''), as other presets are already perfect for doubletracks.Tags are ordered by importance.

Available through the JOSM presets search engine and at this address: https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Presets/MtbSingletrack

## Presets I took inspiration from

* [Presets/MountainbikeTrails](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Presets/MountainbikeTrails)
* [Presets/Mountainbike](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Presets/Mountainbike)
* Path item of JOSM Default Presets
