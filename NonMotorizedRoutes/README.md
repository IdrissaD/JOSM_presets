# Comprehensive presets for non-motorized routes

I was searching presets for tagging routes that were comprehensive and with really detailed descriptions, so I wrote my own nice and complete presets, for many kinds of non-motorized routes. Tags are ordered by importance.
For now adapted to all the `route` values listed [here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:route#Non-motorized_land_routes):
- `hiking`
- `bicycle`
- `piste`
- `mtb`
- `ski`
- `horse`
- `foot`
- `running`
- `nordic_walking`
- `inline_skates`
- `transhumance`

Fully translated in french, please submit a pull request if you'd like to add a language!

## Presets I took inspiration from

* My own [Presets/Mtbsingletrack](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/wiki/Presets/MtbSingletrack)
* Internal presets of JOSM
